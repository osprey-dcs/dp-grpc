# dp-grpc — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview

This repo defines the gRPC API for the **Machine Learning Data Platform (MLDP)** — a high-performance archive for PV (process variable) time-series data from large-scale research facilities such as particle accelerators. The project produces a JAR of compiled Java stubs generated from the proto files; it does not run as a standalone service.

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/osprey-dcs/dp-grpc
- **Project home**: https://github.com/osprey-dcs/data-platform
- **Java package prefix**: `com.ospreydcs.dp.grpc.v1` (generated classes use service-scoped packages such as `com.ospreydcs.dp.grpc.v1.common`, `.query`, `.ingestion`, `.annotation`, and `.ingestion_stream`)
- **Maven coordinates**: `com.ospreydcs:dp-grpc` (see `pom.xml` for current version)
- **Java target**: 21

## Proto Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `common.proto` | Shared data structures used by all services |
| `ingestion.proto` | DpIngestionService — provider registration, data ingestion, subscriptions, request status |
| `query.proto` | DpQueryService — time-series data query, PV metadata query, provider query |
| `annotation.proto` | DpAnnotationService — PV metadata, machine configuration, DataSets, Annotations, Calculations, data export |
| `ingestion_stream.proto` | DpIngestionStreamService — data event subscriptions |

Proto files are compiled by the `protobuf-maven-plugin` (0.6.1) using `protoc` and `grpc-java`. Generated Java sources land in `target/generated-sources/`.

## Key Concepts

### Column Messages (`common.proto`)
Data is stored and transmitted in **column-oriented** vectors, one column per PV per request. Column message types:

- **Scalar**: `DoubleColumn`, `FloatColumn`, `Int64Column`, `Int32Column`, `BoolColumn`, `StringColumn`, `EnumColumn`
- **Array**: `DoubleArrayColumn`, `FloatArrayColumn`, `Int64ArrayColumn`, `Int32ArrayColumn`, `BoolArrayColumn`
- **Complex**: `ImageColumn`, `StructColumn`, `SerializedDataColumn`
- **Deprecated for ingestion only**: `DataColumn` / `DataValue` (per-sample allocation; avoid for new ingestion). Still the supported representation for tabular/sample query results (e.g. the Query V2 `ColumnTable`) and Annotation Calculations, where an unset `DataValue` oneof provides missing-value support the dense types lack.

Each column message carries an optional `ColumnMetadata metadata = 10` field (added in issue #116) containing `ColumnProvenance` (source/process), `tags`, and `attributes`.

### Configuration and ConfigurationActivation (`common.proto`)
Shared messages for the machine configuration API (added in issue #120):

- **`Configuration`** — reusable machine configuration definition. `configurationName` is the canonical primary key. Fields: `category` (required), `description`, `parentConfigurationName`, `tags`, `attributes`, `createdTime`, `updatedTime`, `modifiedBy`.
- **`ConfigurationActivation`** — time interval during which a Configuration was active. Fields: `clientActivationId` (optional client-supplied key; server-generates if absent), `configurationName`, `startTime`, `endTime` (absent = open-ended), `description`, `tags`, `attributes`, `createdTime`, `updatedTime`, `modifiedBy`.

Placed in `common.proto` so query and other services can reference them without import cycles.

### DataFrame (`common.proto`)
The unit of ingestion. Contains `DataTimestamps` (either a `SamplingClock` or explicit `TimestampList`) plus lists of the column message types above.

### DataBucket (`common.proto`)
The unit of query results. One PV, one time range, one column message (via `DataValues` oneof).

### DataTimestamps (`common.proto`)
Two modes:
- `SamplingClock` — start time + period (nanos) + count (uniform sampling)
- `TimestampList` — explicit list of `Timestamp` messages

### TimeRange (`common.proto`)
Shared query time interval (added in issue #123 for Query API V2): `beginTime`, `endTime`. Half-open `[beginTime, endTime)` at the sample axis; bucket selection is an overlap test (`bucket.firstTime < endTime AND bucket.lastTime >= beginTime`).

### Bucket Pattern
Ingestion and storage use the [MongoDB bucket pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-bucket-pattern): all sample values for a PV over a time range are stored as a single record, not one record per sample.

### Asynchronous Ingestion
Ingestion responses only confirm acceptance/rejection. Actual persistence is async. Use `queryRequestStatus()` to check outcomes.

### Response Pattern
All response messages use a `oneof result` with either `ExceptionalResult` (rejection/error) or a method-specific success payload.

A query matching no data returns an **empty result, not an `ExceptionalResult`** — verified against the dp-service dispatchers. Reserve exceptional results for rejected requests and server errors. Some proto comments contradicted this and were corrected; see "Proto comments drift" below.

## Services

### DpIngestionService (`ingestion.proto`)
- `registerProvider` — must be called before ingesting; safe to call on every client startup
- `ingestData` / `ingestDataStream` / `ingestDataBidiStream` — unary / client-streaming / bidi-streaming ingestion
- `subscribeData` — bidi-stream subscription to live PV data from the ingestion pipeline
- `queryRequestStatus` — check async ingestion request outcomes

### DpQueryService (`query.proto`)

V1 (retained for backward compatibility):
- `queryData` / `queryDataStream` / `queryDataBidiStream` / `queryTable` — retrieve archived time-series data
- `queryPvStats` — PV archive statistics (first/last timestamp, data type, bucket stats)
- `queryProviders` — find providers by id, text, tags, attributes
- `queryProviderStats` — ingestion statistics for a provider

V2 (added in issue #123): a common `QuerySpec` (time range + `PvSelector` [name list / regex / metadata criteria] + `ConfigurationSelector`) is bundled with `ExecutionOptions` (paging: `limit`/`pageToken`) and `ResultRepresentation` (format flags) in each request. `QuerySpec` field 4 reserves a future `sampleStatusSelector`.
- `queryBuckets` / `queryBucketsStream` — bucket-oriented; returns `DataBucket` objects, boundary buckets whole. Unary is resumable/paged; streaming is fire-and-consume (chunked, no continuation tokens).
- `querySamples` / `querySamplesStream` — sample-oriented; returns an aligned column-oriented `ColumnTable` (union timestamp axis, samples trimmed to `[beginTime, endTime)`, missing values via unset `DataValue`). Preferred for Python/analysis.

### DpAnnotationService (`annotation.proto`)
- `savePvMetadata` / `queryPvMetadata` / `getPvMetadata` / `deletePvMetadata` — PV metadata CRUD (`patchPvMetadata` / `bulkSavePvMetadata` deferred stubs)
- `saveConfiguration` / `queryConfigurations` / `getConfiguration` / `deleteConfiguration` — machine configuration definition CRUD (`patchConfiguration` / `bulkSaveConfiguration` deferred stubs)
- `saveConfigurationActivation` / `queryConfigurationActivations` / `getConfigurationActivation` / `deleteConfigurationActivation` / `getActiveConfigurations` — configuration activation CRUD and point-in-time query (`patchConfigurationActivation` / `bulkSaveConfigurationActivation` deferred stubs)
- `saveDataSet` / `queryDataSets` — manage DataSets (blocks of PVs × time ranges)
- `saveAnnotation` / `queryAnnotations` — manage Annotations (text, tags, attributes, Calculations, provenance)
- `exportData` — export DataSets and/or Calculations to HDF5, CSV, or XLSX

### DpIngestionStreamService (`ingestion_stream.proto`)
- `subscribeDataEvent` — bidi-stream subscription that fires when a `PvConditionTrigger` condition is met in the live ingestion stream, optionally returning EventData for a time window around the trigger

## Proto Conventions

- Elements within a proto file are ordered: service definition → request/response messages → supporting types.
- All method parameters are bundled into a single `*Request` message.
- Request/response message names mirror the method name (e.g., `registerProvider` → `RegisterProviderRequest` / `RegisterProviderResponse`).
- Shared messages go in `common.proto`; service-scoped messages stay in the service's proto file.
- Nested messages are used to limit scope where the type is only used within one parent message.
- Empty query results return an empty list in the result payload, not an `ExceptionalResult`.

### CRUD Pattern for Metadata APIs

Metadata APIs follow a standard CRUD method set. `DpAnnotationService.savePvMetadata` /
`queryPvMetadata` / `getPvMetadata` / `deletePvMetadata` / `patchPvMetadata` /
`bulkSavePvMetadata` is the reference implementation of this pattern.
`saveConfiguration` / `saveConfigurationActivation` and their associated CRUD methods
are a second implementation of this pattern.

**Standard method set:**

| Method | Semantics | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `save*` | Full-replace upsert (create or replace) | Implemented |
| `query*` | Structured multi-criterion search with pagination | Implemented |
| `get*` | Single-record lookup by primary key | Implemented |
| `delete*` | Delete record by primary key | Implemented |
| `patch*` | Partial update via field mask | Deferred (see below) |
| `bulkSave*` | Bulk full-replace upsert for large imports | Deferred (see below) |

**Pagination** (`query*` methods): use `uint32 limit` + `string pageToken` in the request
and `string nextPageToken` in the result message. An empty `nextPageToken` signals the last
page. Do not include a `totalCount` field — obtaining it requires an expensive separate
count query against MongoDB.

**Query criteria**: use `repeated *Criterion criteria` (not `clauses`). Multiple criteria
are combined with AND; multiple values within a single criterion are combined with OR.
Name/alias criteria provide `exact`, `prefix`, and `contains` sub-lists (all ORed).
`AttributesCriterion` uses an empty `values` list to mean key-only (existence) search —
do not add a `keyOnly` flag.

**`save*` full-replace warning**: comments on `Save*Request` must explicitly warn that all
fields are replaced on update and callers must supply the complete desired state. Reference
`patch*` as the future partial-update path.

**`Save*Request` flat fields**: request messages must list only client-settable fields
explicitly — do not embed the full domain message (e.g., `Configuration`,
`ConfigurationActivation`) since those contain server-set audit fields (`createdTime`,
`updatedTime`) that must not be accepted as input. Add a `Note:` comment stating that
audit timestamps are server-set and returned in query/get responses only.

**Optional client-supplied key** (`clientActivationId` pattern): when an entity may be
loaded from an external system (e.g., a calendar), provide an optional client-supplied
string key. The server generates an opaque ID if omitted. `get*` and `delete*` and
`patch*` requests for such entities use `oneof key` accepting either the client key or a
composite natural key (e.g., `configurationName` + `startTime`). The generated ID is
returned in the save result so callers can retain it.

**Deferred methods** (`patch*`, `bulkSave*`): include the RPC stub and request/response
messages in the proto even when not yet implemented, to reserve names and establish the
pattern. Mark them clearly in both the service comment and the request message comment:

```proto
/*
 * patchFoo()
 *
 * <description of intended behavior>
 *
 * NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — calling this method returns an error response.
 * Planned for a future release.
 *
 * This method is defined now to reserve its name and message shapes as part
 * of the standard CRUD pattern for metadata APIs in this service.
 */
rpc patchFoo(PatchFooRequest) returns (PatchFooResponse);
```

The service handler must return `RESULT_STATUS_ERROR` with a "not implemented" message
for deferred methods.

## Documentation

Three distinct documents, with different jobs. Keep them in their lanes:

| Where | Genre | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Reference | Every method, request, and response, field by field |
| `doc/cookbook/` | Guide | Task-oriented recipes spanning multiple calls |
| Proto comments | Contract | Per-message and per-method semantics |

### Cookbook (`doc/cookbook/`)

One recipe per API area, plus `conventions.md` for patterns shared by every method
(`oneof result` handling, paging, criteria AND/OR rules, full-replace `save*`, half-open
time ranges). Recipes **link to `conventions.md` rather than repeating it**.

Recipe structure, established by `machine-configuration.md`:

1. H1 title, then a one-or-two sentence statement of what it covers
2. A `> **Verified against:** dp-grpc rel-X.Y.Z` blockquote — state the release the recipe
   was checked against, and call out any method that does not exist in that release
3. Reference links to the relevant `README.md` anchors and to `conventions.md`
4. An imports block, where the recipe uses deeply nested generated classes
5. `## Contents`, then `## Model` explaining domain concepts before any code
6. Task-oriented `##` sections with numbered steps
7. `## Also worth knowing` for the leftovers

Conventions:

- **Java only.** Python users are directed to
  [dp-python-lib](https://github.com/osprey-dcs/dp-python-lib); client-library usage is
  documented there, not here. `python-stubs.md` covers only stub generation, which is this
  repo's business.
- **Class names are unqualified inline** for readability. Recipes using nested types carry an
  imports block up front giving the full resolution path.
- **Say when something is unspecified.** Where the protos do not state a behavior, write that
  rather than guessing. Several recipes do this today and those spots are candidates for
  replacing with observed server behavior.
- When adding a recipe, add it to both `doc/cookbook/README.md` and the `## API Cookbook`
  table in `README.md`, and add a pointer from the relevant entity API section.

### Verifying documentation

Two independent checks — they catch different things, so run both:

```bash
mvn compile                                   # names and shapes, via the protos
python3 tools/check-cookbook-snippets.py      # every ```java block, via javac
```

`tools/check-cookbook-snippets.py` extracts every ```java block in `doc/cookbook/`, wraps each
in a class with wildcard imports plus that document's own imports block, and compiles the lot
against `target/classes`. It exits non-zero on any unresolved **type** or syntax error, so it
works as a pre-commit or CI gate. Run `mvn compile` first. `--keep DIR` retains the generated
sources for inspection.

Two things it deliberately tolerates:

- **Unresolved lowerCamelCase names** (`response`, `stub`) — snippets are fragments, so locals
  are expected to be undeclared. Note that javac reports an unknown *type* used as an expression
  receiver as `symbol: variable Foo`, so the filter keys on capitalization: `Foo` is a type
  reference and a real error, `foo` is a fragment's local.
- **Snippets marked `// cookbook:partial <reason>`** — a placeholder type standing in for
  something the caller supplies, or an interface with methods elided. Keep these rare, and
  always make the elision visible to the reader as well.

The snippet check is not redundant with careful review: it found four defects a name-level
verification pass had missed, including invalid Java (`now - 24h`) and a type that exists
nowhere in the protos. It also flags recipes that reference nested generated classes without
giving an imports block, which is the most common way a snippet becomes uncompilable.

### Proto comments drift

Writing recipes is unusually effective at surfacing stale proto comments — nine were found and
fixed this way. When a doc and a proto comment disagree, **check `dp-service` before assuming
the comment is right**; it is the authority on actual behavior. Two cases seen so far:

- Comments referencing removed fields (`eventMetadata`) or fields that were never added
  (`useSerializedDataColumns` on V1 `QuerySpec`)
- Comments describing superseded behavior — seven query methods listed "no data matching
  query" as an `ExceptionalResult` case, but the dispatchers return an empty result

## Build

```bash
mvn compile          # compile proto files and generate Java stubs
mvn package          # build the JAR
```

Generated Java sources appear in `target/generated-sources/protobuf/`.

## Releases

Tagged as `rel-<version>`. Release artifacts (JAR + SHA-256 checksum) are attached to GitHub releases. See `README.env` for download and verification instructions.

## Planning Artifacts

Design documents and implementation plans are stored under `.dev/plan/issue-<N>/` and are gitignored.
